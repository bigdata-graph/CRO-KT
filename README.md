# CRO-KT: Cognitive Representation Optimization for Knowledge Tracing

This repository implements a knowledge tracing framework (CRO-KT) for educational data mining, focusing on processing education datasets and building models to predict student performance on educational tasks.


## Overview
The project aims to generate student interaction sequences from ASSISTments datasets (2009 and 2012 versions) and build knowledge tracing models. Key functionalities include:
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, filtering, and feature extraction)
- Construction of problem-skill bipartite graphs
- Generation of student interaction sequences with cognitive relevance optimization
  


## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ (tested with Python 3.7)
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`)


### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CRO-KT.git
   cd CRO-KT
